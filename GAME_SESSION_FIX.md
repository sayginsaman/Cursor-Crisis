# Game Session Fix Documentation

## Issues Fixed

1. **HTTP 400 Error on Session Start**: The frontend was sending an empty request body, but the backend expected `gameMode`.
2. **Field Name Mismatch**: Frontend sent `finalLeaderboardPoints` and `finalSkillPoints`, but backend expected `leaderboardPointsEarned` and `skillPointsEarned`.
3. **Session ID Not Parsed**: Frontend wasn't parsing the actual session ID from the server response.
4. **Profile Lookup Error**: Backend was incorrectly looking up profiles by `user_id` instead of using the profile ID directly from the JWT token.
5. **Missing Database Columns**: The `game_sessions` table was missing several columns that the backend code expected.

## Changes Made

### Frontend Changes (C++)

1. **AuthNetworkManager.cpp**:
   - Fixed `StartGameSession` to include `gameMode: "normal"` in the request body
   - Fixed `EndGameSession` to use correct field names (`leaderboardPointsEarned`, `skillPointsEarned`)
   - Added `endReason: "player_death"` field

2. **PlayState.cpp**:
   - Added JSON parsing to extract session ID from server response
   - Improved error handling to show detailed error messages
   - Added proper session state management

### Backend Changes (Node.js)

1. **GameSessionService.js**:
   - Fixed `startSession`, `getUserStats`, and `getActiveSession` to use profile ID directly instead of looking it up by user_id
   - Profile ID is now correctly obtained from the JWT token

### Database Changes (SQL)

1. **Created add_missing_game_sessions_columns.sql**:
   - Added missing columns to `game_sessions` table:
     - `game_mode` - Track different game modes
     - `status` - Track session status (in_progress, completed, abandoned)
     - `leaderboard_points_earned` - Points earned for leaderboard
     - `skill_points_earned` - Skill points earned in session
     - `started_at` / `ended_at` - Detailed timing
     - `end_reason` - Why the session ended
     - `enemies_spawned` - Enemy spawn tracking
   - Created `game_progress_snapshots` table for real-time progress tracking
   - Added indexes for performance

## How to Apply the Fix

1. **Apply Database Migration**:
   ```bash
   # Connect to your Supabase database and run:
   psql -h [your-supabase-host] -U postgres -d postgres -f backend/sql/add_missing_game_sessions_columns.sql
   ```

2. **Restart Backend Server**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

3. **Rebuild Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   make clean
   make
   ```

4. **Test the Game**:
   - Start the game with `./run_game.sh`
   - Game sessions should now start successfully
   - Progress should be saved every 5 seconds
   - Scores should persist properly when the game ends

## Verification

After applying these fixes, you should see:
- "Game session started successfully! Session ID: [uuid]" instead of "HTTP 400" error
- Progress saves every 5 seconds with "Saving progress to server..." message
- Proper session end with score persistence
- No more "Cannot save progress - no active session" errors

## Additional Notes

- The game now properly handles offline mode if the server is unavailable
- Session IDs are properly parsed from server responses
- All three score types (normal, leaderboard, skill) are tracked and saved
- The system gracefully handles network errors with detailed error messages
