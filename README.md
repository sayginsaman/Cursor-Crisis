# Cursor Crisis (Cursor Game)

## ⚠️ Project Status: Paused
This project is currently on hold due to technical limitations in the Cursor AI backend and misalignment with my current goals.

## ❓What It Was
A casual roguelite game using a desktop cursor as the main character. The player would battle through waves of enemies on a digital desktop environment.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Cursor AI
- C++ (Backend)
- JSON-based state management

## 🧠 Challenges Faced
- Inability to persist game data due to `401 Unauthorized` backend errors.
- Session state issues (“Cannot save progress - no active session”).
- Game logic worked partially, but core features like leaderboard + score saving were unreliable.

## 🎯 Why It Matters
This was a learning project to explore Cursor AI and game architecture. The idea is shelved for now, but the experience directly informs future projects I’m developing.
