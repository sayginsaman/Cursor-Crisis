# Real Data Migration Complete ‚úÖ

## Overview
Successfully migrated Desktop Survivor Dash from sample/demo data to real user-driven data collection using Supabase PostgreSQL database.

## What Was Removed

### 1. Sample Data Scripts
- ‚ùå `backend/scripts/seed-dlc.js` - Removed sample DLC items
- ‚ùå `backend/scripts/seedSkills.js` - Removed MongoDB skills seeding
- ‚ùå `backend/scripts/seedSupabaseSkills.js` - Removed pre-populated skills

### 2. MongoDB Models (Legacy)
- ‚ùå `backend/src/models/User.js` - Replaced with Supabase UserService
- ‚ùå `backend/src/models/GameSession.js` - Replaced with GameSessionService
- ‚ùå `backend/src/models/Skill.js` - Replaced with SkillService
- ‚ùå `backend/src/models/DLCItem.js` - Replaced with Supabase tables

### 3. Demo Data in Frontend
- ‚ùå Hardcoded leaderboard entries in `HomeState.cpp`
- ‚ùå Fake skills data with preset levels
- ‚ùå Mock user currency (250 skill points, 1500 coins)
- ‚ùå Demo data in `NetworkManager.cpp`

## What Was Created

### 1. Real Data Collection Service
- ‚úÖ `GameSessionService.js` - Comprehensive game session tracking
  - Real-time session start/end tracking
  - Experience and level calculation
  - Skill point and coin rewards
  - Achievement system
  - User statistics aggregation

### 2. Updated API Routes
- ‚úÖ `routes/game.js` - Now uses Supabase services
- ‚úÖ `routes/leaderboard.js` - Real leaderboards from user sessions  
- ‚úÖ `routes/skills.js` - Already using SkillService

### 3. Clean Frontend State
- ‚úÖ Empty initial data that gets populated from API calls
- ‚úÖ Proper starting values (0 skill points, 100 coins, level 1)

## How Real Data Collection Works

### Game Sessions
1. **Start Session**: POST `/api/game/session/start`
   - Creates new session in `game_sessions` table
   - Returns session ID for tracking

2. **End Session**: POST `/api/game/session/end`
   - Records final score, survival time, kills, damage
   - Calculates experience rewards (score/100 + kills*10 + survival*5)
   - Awards skill points (1 per 500 XP)
   - Awards coins (random bonus based on performance)
   - Updates user level and statistics
   - Returns progression rewards

### User Progression
- **Experience**: Earned from score, kills, and survival time
- **Levels**: Calculated using exponential curve (base 1000 XP, 1.5x multiplier)
- **Skill Points**: 1 point per 500 XP earned, used to upgrade skills
- **Coins**: Random rewards based on performance, future currency system

### Statistics Tracking
- Best score and personal records
- Total kills, deaths, damage dealt/taken
- Play time, games played
- Level progression and experience

### Achievements
Real-time achievement tracking based on user stats:
- First Blood (first kill)
- Centurion (100 kills)
- Survivor (5 minutes survival)
- High Scorer (10,000 points)
- Persistent (10 games played)
- Experienced (level 10)
- Dedicated (1 hour playtime)

### Leaderboards
Real leaderboards based on actual user sessions:
- **Scores**: Highest scores (daily/weekly/monthly/all-time)
- **Survival**: Longest survival times
- **Kills**: Most kills in single session
- User ranking system shows your position vs other players

## Skills System
- Skills start empty - users must earn and unlock them through gameplay
- No pre-populated skills in database
- Users unlock skills by reaching required levels
- Skill progression tied to real experience and skill points earned

## Database Schema (Supabase)
- ‚úÖ `profiles` - User profiles with stats and progression
- ‚úÖ `game_sessions` - Individual game session records
- ‚úÖ `skills` - Skill definitions (empty initially)
- ‚úÖ `user_skills` - User skill progression
- ‚úÖ `skill_effects` - Skill effect definitions
- ‚úÖ `skill_prerequisites` - Skill unlock requirements

## Next Steps

### For Backend
1. **Skills Content**: Add actual skills to the database when ready
2. **DLC System**: Implement DLC item management system
3. **Analytics**: Add more detailed game analytics
4. **Achievements**: Expand achievement system

### For Frontend
1. **API Integration**: Implement HTTP client in NetworkManager
2. **Real-time Updates**: Connect UI to live backend data
3. **Progression UI**: Show level-up notifications and rewards
4. **Achievement Notifications**: Display achievement unlocks

### For Game Logic
1. **Progression Integration**: Connect game mechanics to skill effects
2. **Session Tracking**: Implement session start/end calls in game loop
3. **Reward System**: Show earned XP, coins, and skill points in-game

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Authentic Progression**: Players earn everything through gameplay
2. **Competitive Elements**: Real leaderboards create competition
3. **Data-Driven Insights**: Actual user behavior analytics
4. **Scalable System**: Database designed for growth and expansion
5. **Achievement Motivation**: Real accomplishments tied to gameplay
6. **Persistent Progress**: User progression saved and tracked over time
